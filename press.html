					Jan Vogler issued the following statement:<br>
					<br>
					<span id = "indented">The Coronavirus (COVID-19) global crisis has changed all of our lives drastically and has shutdown every performing arts institution
						and venue we artists call our homes. While practicing at home on the Upper West Side, I realized that we can still contribute something
						during this fight against this pandemic.<br>
						<br>
						After hours of conversations with my New York-based friends and colleagues I understood they are more eager than ever to express their
						artistry. These friends and colleagues have agreed to create original performance content for Music Never Sleeps NYC to be livestreamed
						over a 24-hour period beginning on March 27 at 6:00PM EDT.<br>
						<br>
						We will all unite to send a musical message of courage, empathy, friendship, hope and love from New York to the entire world. We will
						also encourage those watching the Music Never Sleeps NYC to support various New York charitable cuases that directly benefit New York-based artists.<br>
						<br>
						We hope to inspire other artists in cities around the world to join together and recplicate Music Never Sleeps NYC in their own city. We want to
						create a global pastiche of artistic expression with other cities joining our initiative, e.g. #musicneversleepsLA, #musicneversleepsBerlin,
						#musicneversleepsTokyo, etc.<br>
