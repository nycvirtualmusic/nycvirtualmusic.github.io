					<span class="larger">PRESS QUOTES about Music Never Sleeps NYC March Livestream</span><br>
					<br>

					“Last weekend, live streams escalated to marathons. The cellist Jan Vogler organized a 24-hour event called Music Never Sleeps NYC…<br>
					<br>
					Music Never Sleeps was a feel-good miracle of coordination and collaboration across musical forms and genres. When it overlapped, at 7 p.m. Eastern time, with a moment for New Yorkers to applaud out their windows for those on the front lines of the pandemic, the conductor David Robertson and the pianist Orli Shaham cleverly offered Steve Reich’s “Clapping Music.” Later, Inon Barnatan gave an elegant, at times sublime performance of Schubert’s Piano Sonata in B flat that I hope to one 	day hear in person.<br>
					<br>
					…Music Never Sleeps was a soft fund-raiser — not quite a telethon, but presented with the suggestion that fans donate to the NYC Covid-19 Response & Impact Fund and the Local 802 Musicians’ Emergency Relief Fund.”
					<br>
					<br>
					—The New York Times, March 31, 2020
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					“Musicians everywhere have had their scheduled public performances silenced. Hats off, then, to those living in New York for turning something disastrous into 24 hours of lyrical joy.” <br>
					<br>
					“I can’t boast that I heard every minute of Music Never Sleeps NYC, which ran free of charge on YouTube from 6pm on Friday (New York time) to 6pm on Saturday. I did, however, catch about 30
					solo instrumentalists or family groups, all streaming live from the apartments to which they were confined by quarantine — and I was staggered by the variety, virtuosity and beauty of what they offered.”<br>
					<br>
					“It was all pulled together, in under a week, by the renowned cellist Jan Vogler. What a shining example he has set. Wouldn’t it now be great if the musicians of London, Berlin, Paris and the other great cultural
					capitals filled every weekend until the end of this crisis with continuous streamed live music? Isolation would fly by.”<br>
					<br>
					“Yes, there were technical flaws. Sound frequently lagged behind pictures. Vogler and his co-presenters sometimes jumped in too early. The screen occasionally went blank. Yet that only added to the charm. It was like
					a neighbourhood support group meeting via Zoom — except that this neighbourhood included top-notch instrumentalists, and the whole world had been invited to eavesdrop. I’m glad I did.”<br>
					<br>
					—Excerpts from “Music Never Sleeps NYC review – Musicians Defy the Crisis in Joyous Style” by Richard Morrison, The Times (UK), March 30, 2020
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					“On the morning of Saturday March 28, I came across a tweet promoting an event called Music Never Sleeps NYC, “a 24-hour music video livestream marathon event . . . featuring performances from New York-based artists”, including big names such as composer Nico Muhly and pianist Jeremy Denk.<br>
					<br>
					I brought up the YouTube channel on my television and caught violinist Yevgeny Kutik at home performing Sheila Silver’s “Six Beads on a String”, and a little later Abigel Kralik and Benjamin Beilman played violin duets as their dog lounged on an armchair behind them.<br>
					<br>
					The marathon event was the idea of cellist Jan Vogler, artistic director of the Dresden Music Festival, who said it had “completely absorbed me for the 24 hours and afterwards it felt similar to when a big concert has gone really well”. The broadcast used the Kiswe cloud-based streaming service.”<br>
					<br>
					—Josh Spero, Financial Times, March 31, 2020
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					“So far Music Never Sleeps NYC has been the most impressive out of the many signs of life the classical music industry has sent in these times of lockdown.”<br>
					<br>
					– Michael Stallknecht, Suddeutsche Zeitung, March 29, 2020
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					People who tune in to “Music Never Sleeps NYC” are going to be astonished by the variety. “New York is one of those great creative cities with people creating all kinds of things. After 20 years living there, I’m still amazed at how new generations grow up and bring new things to the table”. There’s going to be plenty of top end “straight” classical (Midori, for example, playing a whole Bach solo violin partita). There will be several duos (partners can play together in this time). But there will also be “some really cool stuff that could only happen in NY – some people who have special talents where I just sit there and go ‘Ooh, I wish I could do that.’” The roster includes “some of the most magical crossover artists I know”, like Bela Fleck, a banjoist whose own albums are impossibly eclectic but who Vogler considers equal in musicality to the best the classical world has to offer. Mandolinist Chris Thile normally plays bluegrass but happens to play Bach quite superbly; folk-based singer-songwriter Aoife O’Donovan blew Vogler away when he saw her two years ago: “so in tune that no classical musician can have such an intonation.”<br>
					<br>
					For an event on this scale, the quality of programming becomes critical. As well as using his own experience from Dresden and Moritzburg, Vogler enlisted some highly experienced friends: Eric Jacobsen, founder of The Knights, and Kathy Schuman, Artistic Director of the Caramoor Festival. The constrained time hasn’t stopped them putting immense thought into the curation, providing an enticing, coherent, varied programme: “We’re mixing younger and older, mixing instruments, mixing different colours. We have humour, we have very deep music, some musical jokes, all kinds of things. Programming is like playing – it’s an artistic work.”<br>

					Jan Vogler issued the following statement:<br>
					<br>
					<span id = "indented">The Coronavirus (COVID-19) global crisis has changed all of our lives drastically and has shutdown every performing arts institution
						and venue we artists call our homes. While practicing at home on the Upper West Side, I realized that we can still contribute something
						during this fight against this pandemic.<br>
						<br>
						After hours of conversations with my New York-based friends and colleagues I understood they are more eager than ever to express their
						artistry. These friends and colleagues have agreed to create original performance content for Music Never Sleeps NYC to be livestreamed
						over a 24-hour period beginning on March 27 at 6:00PM EDT.<br>
						<br>
						We will all unite to send a musical message of courage, empathy, friendship, hope and love from New York to the entire world. We will
						also encourage those watching the Music Never Sleeps NYC to support various New York charitable causes that directly benefit New York-based artists.<br>
						<br>
						We hope to inspire other artists in cities around the world to join together and recplicate Music Never Sleeps NYC in their own city. We want to
						create a global pastiche of artistic expression with other cities joining our initiative, e.g. #musicneversleepsLA, #musicneversleepsBerlin,
						#musicneversleepsTokyo, etc.<br>
